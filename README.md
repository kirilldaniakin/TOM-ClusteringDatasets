Here is the most fresh dataset used for clustering in TOM.  
It contains time series for 1659 GitHub repos of the metrics specified in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oxv0ESghqpLcNdgZnsJT7fhvZeS5gcLj/edit#gid=1878164229) in "time series" sheet.  
We have separate csv file for each of the metric type (commits metrics, issues metrics, etc.). The structure of the csv files is self-explanatory if you care to look inside.
